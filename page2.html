<p>
He is always cheerful and bright.
He’s doing crazy things at all moments, which you can see if you look at various fancams of him.
He partner in crime is Baekhyun, and those two are always causing a ruckus.
Chanyeol, the main rapper, probably has the most fangirls. This is taken from most of the polls on here. He also has a lot of spotlight on him at any given time. On stage or on video
-Park Chan-yeol (born November 27, 1992),[1] better known by the mononym Chanyeol, is a South Korean rapper, singer, songwriter and actor. He debuted in 2012 as a member of the South Korean-Chinese boy group EXO and its sub-unit EXO-K.
