<h1> We Are One </h1>

<p> Exo is a South Korean-Chinese boy group based in Seoul. Formed by S.M. Entertainment in 2011, the group debuted in 2012 with twelve members separated into two subgroups, Exo-K (Suho, Baekhyun, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai, and Sehun) and Exo-M (Xiumin, Lay, Chen, Tao [fn 1] and former members Kris and Luhan), performing music in Korean and Mandarin respectively. Exo's first album XOXO (2013), which contained the breakthrough hit "Growl", was a critical and commercial success, winning both Disk Daesang at the 28th Golden Disk Awards and Album of the Year at the 15th Mnet Asian Music Awards. It sold over one million copies, making Exo the best-selling Korean artist in twelve years.[1] Subsequent albums and EPs continued with strong sales, and Exo were ranked the most influential celebrity by Forbes Korea Power Celebrity for the year 2014[2] and 2015.[3] They have been named "the biggest boyband in the world" by media outlets, saying that "EXO are at the forefront of pop domination, with knife-point choreography seamlessly gelled to songs crafted by some of the world’s most gifted writers and producers, honed by their myriad of personalities and talents."

- Because 100 is just so overused. And 200 seem a little not enough. So, here are 300 facts about EXO. Some of which are popularly known and some are not. These are certified true unless the boys lied, the translations were wrong, or the sources made mistakes. But, of course, I’m only human and my brain sometimes might not serve me well so feel free to drop a message in my inbox (non-anon please) if you found anything questionable here. I’ll update this as I see fit.
